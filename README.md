# nx-TAS
Rewrite of TAS-nx

This project is still in early development, but it is usable if built from source. It works fundamentally differently than TAS-nx in that it uses a virtual controller to send inputs instead for changing the inputs of the currently used controller. So far, the program only supports 1 script, placed in "sdmc:/scripts/script0.txt". To add the virtual controller, press 0 on the keyboard. To remove the controller, press 9. To press and release the A button (used for activating the controller ingame with the press L and R screen) press 8. To run script0.txt, press 7.

# Features
New features are already planned, such as changing the tye of controller (pro, joycons, sideways joycons, and possibly other controllers), multiple player TAS support, motion controls, some way to combat variable load times, and color customizaition of the controllers.
